This test case provides a single channel test case of Lower Mississippi River.
The upstream point is at Baton Rouge Gage (RS=231.46) and the downstream point is at Belle Chasse (RS=76.37).
The original Hec-RAS model had 'Ineffective flow area' in several cross sections of the river. Those parts have been removed as the current MSH code (version_2) does not have any option to consider this feature.
